    <description>k__BackingField: "   A mode where the players spawns in a random
      position and needs to find the exit. To find the path there is a light that
      gets spawned with the player which the player should follow. Along the path,
      the player will encounter enemies (or haters) which the player needs to kill.\r\n\n  
      You gain skulls when you kill an enemy, every enemy gives you different number
      of skulls. But in the UI, there will be two indicators: all kills, and skulls
      that you can spend."
